Interface::Param version 0.2
=================

This abstract class allows you to quickly and easily add a method to your 
objects which stores key/value pairs and allows you to retrieve them.  The 
functionality is not unlike the param() method from CGI.pm (which you're 
probably familiar with).  The default distribution includes a subclass
Interface::Param::Hash which I think most module authors will find useful.
